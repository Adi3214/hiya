        <h1>Dear Hiya,</h1>
        <p>Here is your letter:</p>
        <p>Hey Hiya, 
            I might have said some things that made you pissed. But aisa nahi hai ki me bilkul nahi milta every second day I am with you and idk why you seem to ignore it. I know we dont go on trips and all but its a consequence of me telling my parents about you. You are the only girl i ever told them because you are really special to me. What you expect out of a relationship and what I am providing is no where near to it. And no doubt if it was one of your other privileged bumble dates they would have kept you really happy in what you dont get in this relationship. But they would not be as loving , supportive and caring as I am for you. I think i just have alot of shit in life and I am dragging you with it. 
            I am sorry for that. 
            I am sorry for not being like other relationship 
            I am sorry for how my friends are
            I am sorry for how restrictive my family is
            I am sorry for not having enough time for this relationship 
            But I am not sorry for loving you. 
            Even though our understanding are not really on the same level you still are the only person who understands me the most. Not even my parents or friends understand me this much. Your smile is worth taking a day off for. Tune bhut kuch sikhaya mereko and I'll be forver greatful and privileged that I dated Miss Hiya Gadhavi. Idk we might go our separate ways if it is too much for you but I would always hope for your best of the best because you do deserve that. I made a promise to myself ki me apni partner ko bhut queen jaisa rakhu ga and yes I failed. 
            Even if you decide us going seperate ways , I would still wait for you until somehow I hear from someone that you have found someone now. I dont care if it takes whole life but I am not going anywhere until you find someone. Mummy kasam.
            If you do decide to stay, all I want to say is ki mera ye saal bhut mushkil hai mere liye bhut cheeze experience ki hai mene, mom dad ki ladai, unki mental health , loosing friends, loosing a job offer and somehow it is starting to put effect in this relationship too. All of this has just made me so weak and dull that its effecting us. 
            Trust me when I say this I really believe that sabke liye koi na koi bana hai and I really feel ki tu mere liye bani hai. Ye time nikal jaye aur me bas tereko itna khush rakhu ki baaki log hamare relationship se jeolous ho. 
            But that doesn't mean ki abhi I wont still try to keep you happy. I still will and always will. 
            
            I’ve never had a moment’s doubt. I love you. I believe in you completely. You are my dearest one. My reason for life
            
            I lovee you Pippo
            Are you breaking up with me?
            Please just say YES or NO. </p>
